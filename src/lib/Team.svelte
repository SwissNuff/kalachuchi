        Hi there! I'm Arian Rey. ðŸ‘‹ I am a 4th-year Computer Science student at
        the University of the Philippines - Diliman, specializing in UI/UX
        design and software development. Currently, I am passionate about
        developing Keller, a browser extension that helps low-vision and blind
        people generate alternative text for images. With this project, I aim to
        raise awareness and increase efforts to make technology more accessible
        in the Philippines. I've also worked on other cool projects. If you're
        interested, please visit my website to check them out:
