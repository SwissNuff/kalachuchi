        Hey there! I'm Cess 👋 My journey is at the exciting intersection of
        design and technology.
        <br /><br />
        I wear many hats—currently a senior standing computer science student at
        UP Diliman, and offering freelance services on UI/UX design and others.
        <br /><br />
        As a healthtech innovator, CEO and co-founder of VitalRadar, we aim to empower

        Hi I’m Chrissy! I'm currently a BS Computer Science student at the
        University of the Philippines - Diliman, specializing in Natural
        Language Processing (NLP). I contributed to a published conference paper
        on training the PEGASUS large language model for summarizing COVID-19
        research papers.
        <br /><br />
        I am also active in student organizations, having served as part of the executive
        committee and as finance head in several teams. I enjoy making music, experimenting
        with painting, sculpting, gaming, and building figurines.
